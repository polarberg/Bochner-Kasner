# Bochner-Kasner #
This is where I will put all my code

## To-Do  ##
### Priority ###
- [ ] Symbolic Differentiation
- [ ] bessel function
    - [ ] Residuals (Numerical - exact)
        - [ ] function so it can iterate over arrays
    - [ ] exact initial conditions for numerical 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

#### Future Plans ####
- [ ] bessel function
- [ ] bessel function residuals 
- Find out why big.() has a lot of noise 
- plotting in 3d?
- making the equation look more intuitive 
- automatic way to test many solvers at once     
- residuals
