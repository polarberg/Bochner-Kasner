# Bochner-Kasner
This is where I will put all my code

Future plans?
    - [ ] bessel function
    - [ ] bessel function residuals 
    - Find out why big.() has a lot of noise 
    - plotting in 3d?
    - making the equation look more intuitive 
    - automatic way to test many solvers at once     
    - residuals
